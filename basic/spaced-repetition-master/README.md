# Spaced Repetition Software

This is a desktop application that allows the users to create flash cards, that are shown at a software-determined time.

Every time the user gets a question wrong, the question will appear one minute later until the question is correct. The first time a question is right, the user gets shown in a day, then a week, then a month, and then a year - and once a year from that point onwards.
